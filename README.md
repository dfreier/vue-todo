# Vue Todos

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a Vue application can take advantage of the Composition API.

## How to start the application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # Open a browser window with the url you see in the console output
```

## How to learn from it

If you'd like to see how the application evolved from plain old Options API to its final version using Composition API, have a look at the individual commits from `01 - Options API` up to `08 - Make todos editable`.
There are also a few branches called `01`, `02`, `03`, `04` and `05`. Each of them has a few further commits with comments in the code, explaining the concepts.
